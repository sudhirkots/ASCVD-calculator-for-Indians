# ASCVD-calculator-for-Indians
This is an Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Calculator for Indians, based on the Lipid Association of India guidelines.

Indians have been shown to be at higher risk of getting atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, as it tends to be more aggressive and occurs earlier. The Lipid Association of India has come out with very nice guidelines on why we need to keep our lipids lower and from an earlier age. 

It categorises people into low risk, high risk, very high risk, etc., and advises the target levels of cholesterol for each risk category.
